Created by KAOS (a.k.a. 4D 1) and gigi for use in GWToolbox++

Credits to:

Sune C (a.k.a. Harboe) and ACB -
Most low level ground work of API via the GWCA and GWLP:R
projects as well as getting the gamerevision community rolling.
Much help from following these two gentlemen's breadcrumbs.

Miracle444 -
GWA2, as well as helping me really understand how the game handles
its memory information.

d8rken -
Zraw menu/api which acted as a gateway to get a grasp of cpp as well
as directx.

gigi -
For getting me to not make everything singletons :P
